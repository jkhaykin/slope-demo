# Slope Best Buy Demo Code

### `fe-demo-tampermonkey.js`
This is the front end code I wrote to inject the slope button and make api calls to the backend. I wanted to get as close of an integration as possible and it's running on my machine via [Tampermonkey](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo).

### `app.py` & `helpers.py`
This is the simple python backend that supports the calls made via tampermonkey.
